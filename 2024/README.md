> #### 🔍 Key Highlights:
>
> ✨ Properties of white light and far-red light grown photosystem I reaction centers differ <br>
> ✨ The lowest excited state of the FRL-RC is lowered by ≈29 nm, and is ≈k<sub>B</sub>T above Chl _f_ <br>
> ✨ The rate of charge separation drops from ≈900 ns<sup>-1</sup> in WL-RC to ≈300 ns<sup>-1</sup> in FRL-RC <br>
> ✨ Trapping in FRL-PSI occurs after uphill energy transfer from the Chl  _f_ compartments <br>
